The data source comes from the Football Players Sports Reference listed below. The 3 football teams I chose to analyze are the San Diego Wave, Portland Thorns FC, and North Carolina Courage from the NWSL. The data specifically analyzed was the player's name, age, number of matches played, and goals scored for each of the football teams. The packages you need in order to reproduce the data are rvest and ggplot2. Additionally, check if the xPath Location matches up with the correct data selected provided on the webpage.
